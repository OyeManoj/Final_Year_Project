**ACKNOWLEDGMENT** 

You will learn more from your failures than your successes - so embrace those mistakes, as dif- ficult as that sounds, and grow from them. When a project is successful, you're never really sure why, because numerous elements inherit play. However, once you fail, you usually know why. that's how you learn and grow. 

This acknowledgement transcends the truth of ritual once we'd adore to precise deep gratitude and reference to all those people behind the screen who guided, inspired and helped me for the completion of our project work. 

I consider myself lucky enough to urge such an honest project. This project would add as an asset to my academic profile. 

I would wish to express my thankfulness to my project guide, 

**Mr. S. Srikanth Reddy** for his constant motivation and valuable help through the project work and Heads of the Departments **Mrs. M. Kiran Jyothi** and **Mrs. Dannam Teressa,** which i ex- press my gratitude to **Rev.Fr.Dr.D.Sunder Reddy**, Principal of **St Joseph’s Degree and PG College, Hyderabad,** for his constant supervision, guidance and co-operation throughout the project.

**Abstract**  

The purpose of Intra-Student Faculty Communication System is to automate the existing manual system by the help of computerized equipment s and full- fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable data/ information can be stored for a longer period with easy assessing and manipulation of the same. The required software and hardware are easily available and easy to work with.  

Intra-Student Faculty Communication System, as described above, can lead to error free, secure, reliable and fast networking system. The organization can maintain computerized records without redundant entries. That means that one need not be distracted by information that is not relevant, while being able to reach the information.

1. **Introduction** 

Social Media sites allow users to communicate with people, share ideas, activities, events, and interests within their individual networks. Social Media sites such as Twitter have attracted millions of users, many of whom have integrated these sites into their daily practices. There are hundreds of Intra- Student Faculty Communication System ing Sites, with various technological a ordances, supporting a wide range of interests and practices. Sites also vary in the extent to which they incorporate new information and communication tools, such as mobile connectivity, blogging, and photo sharing. 

The purpose behind implementing social media with this project is to build such a system through which job seekers i.e. students can stay updated about their jobs post who are in a search of job.

2. **Objective** 

The objective of the project is to explain and elaborate the concept of “Social Media Sites” to the users, hence providing a reliable and e cient Communication online so as to assist stu- dents to a ord it without much trouble. 

- Make new user account in more user friendly and proper validation of details. 
- To have attractive and Secure Login page to access. 
- Post a job details which can be seen by every registered student. 
- Make the job findings easy and build communication with ease.

3. **Existing System & Proposed System** 
1. **Problem with current scenario** 
- Traditionally, there were no such web based application where students could commu- nicate the recruiter company via writing an articles or adding a post. 
- Student use to prefer the newspapers to search for a job of their choice. 
- Colleges may fail to produce the invitation from the recruiter company or any student may also have le\ behind by not sharing the information. 
- Companies were not able to filter out the students who aren’t eligible for a specific job. 
- Printed pamphlet could take more time for processing till it received by the student. 
- Less exposure to the world in the era of technology. 
2. **Proposed System** 

Web application intends to provide a well-established web-based Intra- Student Facul- ty Communication System system between a job seeker and a recruiter. This documents a networking system scope, functionalities, requirements and feasibility. This project aims to develop a website which provides a Communication among peoples on network, which works quite similar to Social Media Site. 

This website also provides the features of writing and posting a post or any event all at one place. The main idea behind it is to share the job related details posted by placement o cer via adding a post which can be read by all the student as well as faculty using the website. This web application can be handled by the admin and manage student as well as faculty. 

**The following points are implemented in proposed system:** 

- Students can register and login into the system once their registration is approved by the ad- min. 
- Once the student logged in into the system, he/she can write and post an articles on various 

49 of 49

topic of his/her choice. Also he/she chat with the other students. 

- Students can also upload images with their post. 
- All students can view News Feed posted by individual student. 
- All the student registration will be approved/rejected by the admin as well as, all the post will be kept pending until admin approves/rejects each and every post. 
- Admin Login has full authority on system, he/she can add/delete Faculty.

4. **Feasibility Report** 

Feasibility Study is a high level capsule version of the entire process intended to an- swer a number of questions like: What is the problem? Is there any feasible solution to the giv- en problem? Is the problem even worth solving? Feasibility study is conducted once the prob- lem clearly understood. Feasibility study is necessary to determine that the proposed system is Feasible by considering the technical, Operational, and Economical factors. By having a de- tailed feasibility study the management will have a clear-cut view of the proposed system. 

The following feasibilities are considered for the project in order to ensure that the project is variable and it does not have any major obstructions. 

Feasibility study encompasses the following things: 

- Technical Feasibility 
- Economic Feasibility 
- Operational Feasibility 

In this phase, we study the feasibility of all proposed systems, and pick the best feasible so- lution for the problem. The feasibility is studied based on three main factors as follows. 

1. **Technical Feasibility** 

In this step, we verify whether the proposed systems are technically feasible or not. i.e., all the technologies required to develop the system are available readily or not. 

Technical Feasibility determines whether the organization has the technology and skills necessary to carry out the project and how this should be obtained. The system can be feasible because of the following grounds: 

- All necessary technology exists to develop the system. 
- This system is too flexible and it can be expanded further. 
- This system can give guarantees of accuracy, ease of use, reliability and the data security. 
- This system can give instant response to inquire. 
- Our project is technically feasible because, all the technology needed for our project is readily available.

**Operating System  :** Windows 7 or higher 

**Languages :** PHP (XAMPP Server & Notepad++) 

**Database System :** My SQL 5.6 

**Documentation Tool  :** MS - Word 2013 

2. **Economic Feasibility** 

Economically, this project is completely feasible because it requires no extra financial investment and with respect to time, it’s completely possible to complete this project in 6 months. 

In this step, we verify which proposal is more economical. We compare the financial benefits of the new system with the investment. The new system is economical- ly feasible only when the financial benefits are more than the investments and expendi- ture. Economic Feasibility determines whether the project goal can be within the re- source limits allocated to it or not. It must determine whether it is worthwhile to process with the entire project or whether the benefits obtained from the new system are not worth the costs. Financial benefits must be equal or exceed the costs. In this issue, we should consider: 

- The cost to conduct a full system investigation. 
- The cost of h/w and s/w for the class of application being considered. 
- The development tool. 
- The cost of maintenance etc... 

Our project is economically feasible because the cost of development is very minimal when compared to financial benefits of the application. 

3. **Operational Feasibility** 

In this step, we verify di erent operational factors of the proposed systems like man- power, time etc., whichever solution uses less operational resources, is the best operationally feasible solution. The solution should also be operationally possible to implement. Operational Feasibility determines if the proposed system satisfied user objectives could be fitted into the current system operation. 

50 of 50

- The methods of processing and presentation are completely accepted by the clients since they can meet all user requirements. 
- The clients have been involved in the planning and development of the system. 
- The proposed system will not cause any problem under any circumstances. 

Our project is operationally feasible because the time requirements and personnel re- quirements are satisfied. We are a team of four members and we worked on this project for three working months.

5. **System Analysis** 

System Analysis is the process of gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problem and using the information to recommend improvement to the system. In brief, we can say that analysis speci- fies what the system should do. System analysis is thus a management technique, which helps in designing a new system or improving an existing system. System Analysis takes into consideration the following: 

- Types of Output Concerned: The objectives or goals are to be determined at first. This is achieved by determining the outputs that the system is supposed to generate. Students can regis-

ter and login into the system once their registration is approved by the admin.Once the student logged in into the system, he/she can write and post an articles on various topic of his/her choice. Also he/she chat with the other students. • Types of inputs Concerned: Based on the output needed to be generated by the project, inputs needed for the projects are determined.Placement o cer can create a list of students by specify- ing the department and criteria. List will include Basic Details, Marks and Backlogs.

**7. Data Flow Diagram** 

A data flow diagram is graphical tool used to describe and analyze movement of data through a system. These are the central tool and the basis from which the other components are developed. The transformation of data from input to output, through processed, may be de- scribed logically and independently of physical components associated with the system. These are known as the logical data flow diagrams. The physical data flow diagrams show the actual implements and movement of data between people, departments and workstations. A full de- scription of a system actually consists of a set of data flow diagrams. Using two familiar nota- tions Yourdon, Gane and Sarson notation develops the data flow diagrams. Each component in a DFD is labeled with a descriptive name. Process is further identified with a number that will be used for identification purpose. The development of DFD’s is done  in several levels. Each process in lower level diagrams can be broken down into a more detailed DFD in the next level. The lop-level diagram is o\en called context diagram. It consists a single process bit, which plays vital role in studying the current system. The process in the context level diagram is ex- ploded into other process at the first level DFD. 

The idea behind the explosion of a process into more process is that understanding at one level of detail is exploded into greater detail at the next level. This is done until further ex- plosion is necessary and an adequate amount of detail is described for analyst to understand the process. 

Larry Constantine first developed the DFD as a way of expressing system requirements in a graphical from, this lead to the modular design. 

49 of 49

A DFD is also known as a “bubble Chart” has the purpose of clarifying system require- ments and identifying major transformations that will become programs in system design. So it is the starting point of the design to the lowest level of detail. A DFD consists of a series of bubbles joined by data flows in the system. 

DFD SYMBOLS: 

In the DFD, there are four symbols 

1. A square defines a source(originator) or destination of system data 
1. An arrow identifies data flow. It is the pipeline through which the information flows 
1. A circle or a bubble represents a process that transforms incoming data flow into outgoing data flows. 
1. An open rectangle is a data store, data at rest or a temporary repository of data

8. **UML Diagram** 

The Unified Modeling Language allows the software engineer to express an analysis model us- ing the modeling notation that is governed by a set of syntactic semantic and pragmatic rules. A UML system is represented using five different views that describe the system from distinctly different perspective. Each view is defined by a set of diagrams, which is as follows.  

**User Model View:**  

`  `This view represents the system from the users perspective.  

`  `The analysis representation describes a usage scenario from the end-users perspective. **Struc- tural model view:**  

`  `In this model the data and functionality are arrived from inside the system. 

`   `This model view models the static structures.  

**Behavioral Model View:**  

It represents the dynamic of behavioral as parts of the system, depicting the interactions of col- lection between various structural elements described in the user model and structural model view. 

` `**Implementation Model View:** In this the structural and behavioral as parts of the system are represented as they are to be built.  

**Environmental Model View:** In this the structural and behavioral aspects of the environment in which the system is to be implemented are represented. 

` `UML is specifically constructed through two different domains they are:  

- UML Analysis modeling, this focuses on the user model and structural model views of the system. 
- UML design modeling, which focuses on the behavioral modeling, implementa- tion modeling and environmental model views of Use case Diagrams.

2. **Entity Relationship(ER) Diagrams:** 

`                        `An entity–relationship model (ER model for short) describes interrelated things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge. A basic ER model is composed of entity types (which classify the things of interest) and specifies relationships that can exist between in- stances of those entity types.  

`                   `In software engineering, an ER model is commonly formed to represent things that a business needs to remember in order to perform business processes. Consequently, the ER model becomes an abstract data model, which defines a data or information structure which can be implemented in a database, typically a relational database.

**Physical ER Diagram Symbols:** 

The physical data model is the most granular level of entity-relationship diagrams, and rep- resents the process of adding information to the database. Physical ER models show all table structures, including column name, column data type, column constraints, primary key, foreign key, and relationships between tables. 

**Fields** 

Fields represent the portion of a table that establish the attributes of the entity. Attributes are typically thought of as columns in the database that the ERD models.

9. **Technology Used** 

**INTRODUCTION** 

PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994. 

- PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor". 
- PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites. 
- It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, 

PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microso\ SQL Server. 

- PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache 

module on the UNIX side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record- setting time. 

- PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, 

and LDAP. PHP4 added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first time. 

- PHP is forgiving: PHP language tries to be as forgiving as possible. 
- PHP Syntax is C-Like. 

**Common uses of PHP:** 

PHP performs system functions, i.e. from files on a system it can create, open, read, write, and close them. The other uses of PHP are: 

49 of 49

- PHP can handle forms, i.e. gather data from files, save data to a file, thru email you can send data, return data to the user. 
- You add, delete and modify elements within your database thru PHP. 
- Access cookies variables and set cookies. 
- Using PHP, you can restrict users to access some pages of your website. 
- It can encrypt data. 

Five important characteristics make PHP's practical nature possible: 

- Simplicity 
- E ciency 
- Security 
- Flexibility 
- Familiarity 
1. **Environment Setup** 

In order to develop and run PHP Web pages, three vital components need to be installed on your computer system. 

**Web Server** - PHP will work with virtually all **Web Server** so\ware, including Microso\'s Internet Information Server (IIS) but then most o\en used is freely available Apache Server. 

**Database** - PHP will work with virtually all database so\ware, including Oracle and Sybase but most commonly used is freely available MySQL database. 

**PHP Parser** - In order to process PHP script instructions, a parser must be installed to generate HTML output that can be sent to the **Web Browser.** 

49 of 49

2. **Overview** 

**Escaping to PHP** 

The PHP parsing engine needs a way to di erentiate PHP code from other elements in the page. The mechanism for doing so is known as 'escaping to PHP.' There are four ways to do this: 

**Canonical PHP tags** 

The most universally e ective PHP tag style is: 

<?php...?> 

If you use this style, you can be positive that your tags will always be correctly inter- preted. 

**Short-open (SGML-style) tags** 

Short or short-open tags look like this: 

<?...?> 

Short tags are, as one might expect, the shortest **option You must** do one of two things to enable PHP to recognize the tags: 

- Choose the --enable-short-tags configuration option when you're 

building PHP. 

- Set the short\_open\_tag setting in your php.ini file to on. This option must be disabled to parse XML with PHP because the same syntax is used for XML tags. 

**ASP-style tags** 

ASP-style tags mimic the tags used by Active Server Pages to delineate code blocks. ASP-style tags look like this: 

<%...%> 

49 of 49

To use ASP-style tags, you will need to set the configuration option in your php.ini 

file. 

**HTML script tags** 

HTML script tags look like this: 

<script language="PHP">...</script> 

3. **Variable Types** 

The main way to store information in the middle of a PHP program is by using a vari- able. 

Here are the most important things to know about variables in PHP. 

- All variables in PHP are denoted with a leading dollar sign ($). 
- The value of a variable is the value of its most recent assignment. 
- Variables are assigned with the = operator, with the variable on the le\- hand side and the expression to be evaluated on the right. 
- Variables can, but do not need, to be declared before assignment. 
- Variables in PHP do not have intrinsic types - a variable does not know in advance whether it will be used to store a number or a string of characters. 
- Variables used before they are assigned have default values. 
- PHP does a good job of automatically converting types from one to another when necessary. 
- PHP variables are Perl-like. 
- PHP has a total of eight data types which we use to construct our variables: 
- **Integers:** are whole numbers, without a decimal point, like 4195. 
- **Doubles:** are floating-point numbers, like 3.14159 or 49.1. 
- **Booleans:** have only two possible values either true or false. 

49 of 49

- **NULL:** is a special type that only has one value: NULL. 
- **Strings:** are sequences of characters, like 'PHP supports string operations.' 
- **Arrays:** are named and indexed collections of other values. 
- **Objects:** are instances of programmer-defined classes, which can package up both other kinds of values and functions that are specific to the class. 
- **Resources:** are special variables that hold references to resources 

external to PHP (such as database connections). 

The first five are *simple types*, and the next two (arrays and objects) are compound - the compound types can package up other arbitrary values of arbitrary type, whereas the simple types cannot. 

4. **XAMPP Server Introduction** 

XAMPP is a Windows OS based program that installs and configures Apache web server, MySQL database server, PHP scripting language, phpMyAdmin (to manage MySQL database’s), and SQLiteManager (to manage SQLite database’s). XAMPP is designed to o er an easy way to install Apache, PHP and MySQL package with an easy to use installation pro- gram instead of having to install and configure everything yourself. XAMPP is so easy because once it is installed it is ready to go. You don’t have to do any additional configuring or tweak- ing of any configuration files to get it running. 

There are usually two reasons why someone chooses to install XAMPP. They are looking to install XAMPP for development purposes or to run their own server.

**9.5.1 PHP Admin** 

Allows you to change or add users and for making new databases phpMyAdmin is a free so\ware tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQLover the World Wide Web. phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations with MySQL. The most frequently used operations are supported by the user interface (managing databases, tables, fields, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc.), while you still have the ability to directly execute any SQL statement. 

**Features** 

- Intuitive web interface 
- Support for most MySQL features: 
- Browse and drop databases, tables, views, fields and indexes. 
- Create, copy, drop, rename and alter databases, tables, fields and indexes. 
- Maintenance server, databases and tables, with proposals on server configuration. 
- Execute, edit and bookmark any SQL-statement, even batch- queries. 
- Manage MySQL users and privileges 
- Manage stored procedures and triggers. 
- Import data from CSV and SQL 
- Export data to various formats: CSV, SQL, XML, PDF, ISO/IEC 26300 - Open- A

Document Text and Spreadsheet, Word, L T*E*X and others 

- Administering multiple servers 
- Creating PDF graphics of your database layout 
- Creating complex queries using Query-by-example (QBE)

- Searching globally in a database or a subset of it 
- Transforming stored data into any format using a set of predefined functions, like displaying BLOB-data as image or download-link 
- And much more... 
6. **SQL Server and Database System** 

![](Aspose.Words.8d34c862-ce0a-428d-8ac9-6e1247fb2f8f.011.png)

SQL Server is a relational database management 

system from Microso\ that's designed for the enterprise environment. SQL Server runs on T-SQL (Transact -SQL), a set of programming extensions 

from Sybase and Microso\ that add several features to standard SQL, including transaction control, exception and error handling, row processing, and declared variables. 

![](Aspose.Words.8d34c862-ce0a-428d-8ac9-6e1247fb2f8f.012.png)

Generically, any database management system (DBMS) that can respond to queries from client machines formatted in the SQL language. When capitalized, the term generally refers to either of two database managementproducts from Sybase and Microso\. Both compa- nies o er client-server DBMS products called *SQL Server.* 

**Using XAMPP as a Development Server** 

49 of 49

You can use XAMPP to develop and test websites locally on their own computer instead of having to get a web hosting account to develop with. Most people will be using XAMPP for development purposes such as learning how to create websites with HTML, PHP, and MySQL. 

**Using XAMPP as a Production Server** 

WARNING: XAMPP was designed to be a testing and development server, not an actual production server. XAMPP does not come with any real security in place so it o ers no protec- tion from any kind of attack. Any 10-year-old with access to the internet can easily hack your XAMPP server. 

If your website(s) have highly sensitive data (such as credit card numbers, social securi- ty numbers, user ids, passwords, etc.), you need to take this in consideration before your put this information online. Unless you are an experienced system administrator and can configure XAMPP to be more secure, you should never user XAMPP for a production server. 

**MySQL Configuration** 

To begin MySQL installation, first download latest version of Essentials as an MSI pack- age. 

During MySQL installation, select *Typical* installation and use default configuration values ex- cept for Sign-Up where you probably want to select *Skip Sign-Up*. When Setup Wizard is com- pleted, make sure the option *Configure the MySQL  Server  now*  is  set.  For  MySQL  Server Instance  Configuration,  select *Standard Configuration*. Next, you *must* set option *Include Bin Directory* 

*in Windows PATH*.  This setting is  *crucial*,  otherwise  a  required library, libMySQL.dll, will not be found later during Apache startup. 

Finally, enter a proper root password. There is no need to neither enable remote root ac- cess nor create an Anonymous Account. 

Please inspect messages during MySQL startup and verify that MySQL has been started successfully. Then, you must reboot the system. Otherwise, the required librarylibMySQL.dll will not be found during Apache startup when Apache is trying to load Apache's PHP module and Apache will, perhaps a bit confusingly, complain that it  is  unable  to  load  the   PHP's MySQL library, php\_mysql.dll. Therefore, it is necessary to reboot the system at this stage and then continue to PHP configuration. 

**PHP Configuration** 

49 of 49

PHP for Windows must be installed from the zip package, *not* using the installer be- cause the installer does not work correctly when setting up the configuration files. Download the latest Windows binary version from the 5.x release series. 

Create folder C:\Program Files\PHP5 and unzip the downloaded package there. Then, in folder C:\Program Files\PHP5 you need to copy the file php.ini- recommended asphp.ini and make two  changes  into  the  php.ini  file.  Change extension\_dir to: 

and also uncomment the following line: 

That is all what is needed for PHP configuration. Additionally, however, if you wish to run PHP from the command line it would be useful to add its installation directory to Windows PATH but for XAMPP to operate it is not 

required. After Apache is installed and configured, also PHP configuration can be tested.

**10 Testing** 

As the project is on bit large scale, we always need testing to make it successful. If each components work properly in all respect and gives desired output for all kind of inputs then project is said to be successful. So the conclusion is-to make the project successful, it needs to be tested. 

The testing done here was System Testing checking whether the user requirements were satisfied. The code for the new system has been written completely using PHP as the coding language, Notepad++ as the interface for front-end designing. The new system has been tested well with the help of the users and all the applications have been verified from every nook and corner of the user. 

Although some applications were found to be erroneous these applications have been corrected before being implemented. The flow of the forms has been found to be very much in accordance with the actual flow of data. 

1. **Levels of Testing** 

In order to uncover the errors present in di erent phases we have the concept of lev- els of testing. The basic levels of testing are:

A series of testing is done for the proposed system before the system is ready for the 

50 of 50

user acceptance testing. 

The steps involved in Testing are: 

2. **Unit Testing** 

Unit testing focuses verification e orts on the smallest unit of the so\ware design**,** the module**.** This is also known as “Module Testing”**.** The modules are tested separately**.** This testing carried out during programming stage itself**.** In this testing each module is found to be working satisfactorily as regards to the expected output from the module**.** 

3. **Integration Testing** 

Data can be grossed across an interface**;** one module can have adverse e orts on an- other**.** Integration testing is systematic testing for construction the program structure while at the same time conducting tests to uncover errors associated with in the interface. The objective is to take unit tested modules and build a program structure**.** All the modules are combined and tested as a whole**.** Here correction is di cult because the isolation of cause is complicate by the vast expense of the entire program. Thus in the integration testing stop**,** all the errors uncovered are corrected for the text testing steps**.** 

4. **System testing** 

System testing is the stage of implementation that is aimed at ensuring that the system works accurately and e ciently for live operation commences. Testing is vital to the success of the system. System testing makes a logical assumption that if all the parts of the system are cor- rect, then goal will be successfully achieved. 

5. **Validation Testing** 

At the conclusion of integration testing so\ware is completely assembled as a pack- age, interfacing errors have been uncovered and corrected and a final series of so\ware tests be- gins**,** validation test begins**.** Validation test can be defined in many ways**.** But the simple defini- tion is that validation succeeds when the so\ware function in a manner that can reasonably  ex- pected by the customer. A\er validation test has been conducted one of two possible conditions exists. 

49 of 49

One is the function or performance characteristics confirm to specifications and are accepted and the other is deviation from specification is uncovered and a deficiency list is creat- ed. Proposed system under consideration has been tested by using validation testing and found to be working satisfactorily. 

6. **Output Testing** 

After performing validation testing, the next step is output testing of the proposed system  since  no  system  could  be  useful  if  it  does  not  produce  the  required  output  in  the specified format. Asking the users about the format required by them tests the outputs generated by the system under consideration. Here the output format is considered in two ways, one is on the screen and other is the printed format. The output format on the screen is found to be correct as the format was designed in the system designed phase according to the user needs. 

For the hard copy also the output comes as the specified requirements by the users. Hence output testing does not result any corrections in the system. 

7. **User Acceptance Testing** 

User acceptance of a system is the key factor of the success of any system. The sys- tem under study is tested for the user acceptance by constantly keeping in touch with the prospective system users at the time of developing and making changes wherever required. 

8. **Test Cases** 

**Registration/Login:** To begin with login, user need to register by filling up basic registration details. There are multiple fields in registration page and every field has to fill by user. User can- not use character in the login id field. 

**Login: -** Every Login id and password is kept compulsory fields, and if the admin id or pass- word doesn’t match then it will show an error message. 

9. **Validation Criteria** 
- In each form, no field which is not null able should be leftblank. 
- All numeric fields should be checked for non-numeric values. Similarly, text fields like names should not contain any numeric characters. 
- All primary keys should be automatically generated to prevent the user from en- tering any existing key. 
- Use of error handling for each Save, Edit, delete and other important operations. 
- Whenever the user Tabs out or Enter from a text box, the data should be validat-


ed and if it is invalid, focus should again be sent to the text box with proper mes- sage. 

11. **Implementation** 

49 of 49

Implementation may be a process of ensuring that the knowledge system is operational. It involves  Constructing a replacement system from scratch 

Constructing a replacement system from the prevailing one. 

Implementation allows the users to require over its operation to be used and evaluation. It involves training the users to handle the system and plan for a smooth conversion. 

**Training:** 

The personnel within the system must know intimately what their roles are going to be , how they will use the system, and what the system will or won't do. The success or failure of welldesigned and technically elegant systems can depend upon the way they're operated and used. 

Training Systems Operators 

Systems operators must be trained properly such they will handle all possible operations, both rou- tine and extraordinary. The operators should be trained in what common malfunctions may occur, the way to recognize them, and what steps to require once they come. 

Training involves creating troubleshooting lists to spot possible problems and remedies for them, also because the names and telephone numbers of people to contact when unexpected or unusual problems arise. 

Training also involves familiarization with run procedures, which involves working through the se- quence of activities needed to use a replacement system. 

**User Training:** 

End-user training is a crucial a part of the computer-based data system development, which must be provided to employees to enable them to try to to their own problem solving. 

User training involves the way to operate the equipment, troubleshooting the system problem, de- termining whether a drag that arose is caused by the equipment or software. 

Most user training deals with the operation of the system itself. The training courses must be de- signed to assist the user with fast mobilization for the organization. 

**Training Guidelines:** 

Establishing measurable objectives 

Using appropriate training methods Selecting suitable training sites 

Employing understandable training materials

13. **Conclusion** 

However, the e ort to develop and maintain Intra-Student Faculty Communication Sys- tem  website is usually far less than that expended for a real life system. In some respects, this approach makes sense for making people communicate on web. The identification of clear-cut interfaces is a standard structured programming technique, which reduces so\ware maintenance costs. The only controversy might be over the particular choice of structure (i.e. Intra-Student Faculty Communication System ing). In general, whenever organizational site is likely to out- live its hardware, this web application approach warrants consideration. This is because of the high redevelopment costs. Now, when such Intra-Student Faculty Communication System is easily approachable to the user via website, it is easy and convenient for them to communicate with the concern person through an article. It gives further opportunity to the coming students to enhance the IT technologies.
